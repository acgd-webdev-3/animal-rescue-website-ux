# Animal rescue website UX

## Overview

We need to plan out the animal rescue website before a single line of code can be written. So do the UX research—you’ll be graded on the completeness of your UX as expected in you IxD class.

Create 1 InVision board (or Google Doc, or AI PDF, etc.) with the following pieces of information:

1. **Target audience:** Who will use your website? Be specific. Personas are encouraged.
2. **Website goals:** What is your website trying to do? How is it trying to do that?
3. **Competitive analysis:** Find competitors; What do they do well? What do they do poorly?
4. **Sitemap:** Include all the possible pages that an animal rescue website would need—but we’ll only be coding a few of them—show how they connect to each other
6. **Visual design**—type & type scale, colours, sample components (buttons, cards, etc.), consider accessibility & performance when making decisions
7. **Wireframes**—home page, inside page, application form page
  *These should be high-fidelity with some real text—paper is okay but use rulers*
  These are the pages we’ll eventually code

## Hand in

During the class that this is due you we’ll show the teacher and discuss with them what you’ve created. You will be graded at that time.
